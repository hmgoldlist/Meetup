	<h1>Index Developer Conference</h1>
	<h2>Meeting and Learning From Leading Developers</h2>
	<p>I have always wanted to go to a conference. Having moved to San Francisco after graduating college, I landed in a place that is recognized worldwide for its innovation and industry leaders. However, it wasn't until I joined an early-stage startup that I actually started to experience that culture first-hand. Many of my colleagues would come into the office either wearing t-shirts of conferences they had attended, or discussing them which left me wanted to experience one myself. Searching for a local MeetUp offered just that opportunity - a chance to attend the Index conference (for free!).</p>
	<p>I attended the Index Conferences on February 20th and 21st. The event was hosted by IBM, but the MeetUp event was hosted by SFHTML5 (check out their website <a href="https://www.meetup.com/sfhtml5/" target="_blank"> here</a>). There are 16,710 members of SFHTML5 - can you believe that! Such a great place to network and learn. The group hosts events very frequently, at least once a month but actually as often as once a week. The group hosts events that feature presentations by industry leading experts using cutting-edge web technologies. My understanding of the goal of the group si to create an environment for people who are either in the field or interested in the field to network and learn from each other. Going into it, I thought that attending the different sessions would be my favorite part because the topics were so fascinating, but speaking with members of the group, and other attendees of the conference ended up being the most valuable. I even was given several business cards and have formed relationships with some of the people I met!</p>
	<p>I went to sessions on a variety of topics but two stood out the most. I studied Neurobiology as an undergrad which is what interested me most in this session. The first session, called "Exploring the Brain-Computer Interface - Flying a Drone with Your Thoughts" was very interesting. The speaker was a man who works at Embarcadero Technologies. He invented and patented the swipe to unlock in 2000! He spoke about the science of reading your brain thoughts and using computers to interpret that input. He then introduced different cutting edge technologies that are capable of translating your thoughts to the computer. At the end, he selected a volunteer from the audience who, without saying a word, thought of which directions that drone should go, and it automatically flew in that direction!</p>
	<p>As someone who is considering a career change, I decided to attend a session called "The Software Developer's Guide to Fun in the Workplace". I learned at my first job after school how important this is, and how important culture is to your overall happiness and the success of the company. The presenter, Holly, worked at IBM, and started by highlighting some things to contribute to fun in the workplace. Some of those steps include: quantifying and qualifying fun metrics, creating a chief fun officer role, gamifying daily tasks, high-fiving eachother in the mornings, wearing fun clothing, and laughing in the office. She brought up a good point which is that programming gies pleasure to both creative and logical thinkers. As someone who is more creative than logical, it made me feel comfortable and encouraged to hear the reinforcement that i'm not the only aspiring developer who is more creative than logical.</p>
	<p>I had a great experience at this conference both in learning and in networking. The members of this MeetUp group who attended were so friendly and welcoming, that I left the conference having learned something new and having felt more connected to the people and culture that makes San Francisco great!</p>
